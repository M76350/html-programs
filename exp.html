    <p>Cow, in common parlance, a domestic bovine, regardless 
        of sex and age, usually of the species Bos taurus. In
         precise usage, the name is given to mature females 
         of several large mammals, including cattle (bovines), moose, elephants, sea lions, and whales.

        Domestic cows are one of 
        the most common farm animals around the world, and the
         English language has several words to describe these 
         animals at various ages. A baby cow is called a calf.
          A female calf is sometimes called a heifer calf and 
          a male a bull calf. A heifer is a female that has not
           had any offspring. The term usually refers to immature females; after giving birth to her first c
           alf, however, a heifer becomes a cow. An adult male is known as a bull. Many male cattle are castrated 
           to reduce their aggressive tendencies and make them more tractable. Young neutered males, which are primarily
            raised for beef, are called steers or bullocks, whereas adult neutered males, which are usually used for draft 
            purposes, are known as oxen. A group of cows, cattle, or kine (an archaic term for more than one cow) constitute
            s a herd. English lacks
         a gender-neutral singula
         r form, and so “cow” is 
         used for both female individuals and all 
         domestic bovines.</p>

         <p>Domestic cattle
            Cows are members of the order Artiodactyla. The order contains even-toed hoofed mammals, and cows have d
            istinctive cloven hooves (derived from the toenails from the middle two digits of each foot). Cows belong
             to the family Bovidae (hollow-horned ruminants, which also includes antelope, sheep, and goats), subfami
             ly Bovinae (which includes buffaloes and spiral-horned antelope), tribe Bovini (which includes cattle, b
             ison, and yak), and genus Bos—the names of which are all derived from bos, the Latin word for cow.
