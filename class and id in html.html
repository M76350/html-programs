<p id="line1"> milk is packed with nutrients like calcium, phosphorus, B vitamins, potassium, and vitamin D. It's also a great source of protein. Drinking milk and dairy products may help prevent osteoporosis and bone fractures, and even help maintain a healthy weight. 
    Milk also contains vitamin B12. A single glass of milk (200 ml, 1.5% fat) provides 36% of the daily recommended intake of vitamin B12. 
    Dairy products have been linked to a reduced risk of high blood pressure. It's thought that the combination of calcium, potassium, and magnesium in milk are responsible for this effect. 
    Three servings of dairy every day can also help reduce the risk for high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes.
